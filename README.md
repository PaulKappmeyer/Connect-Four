# Connect Four
was my favourite game as a child. It's played on a (6 rows) x (7 columns) grid where two players drop either red or yellow tokens down the columns. The two players start by occupying the grid and stacking their tokens with the aim of getting 4 in a row in either a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line.

## Game features
There are three playable **game modes**:
- Player vs. Player: Player vs. Player: Play a game against a friend in a local session.
- Player vs. Computer: Play against the machine. The computer uses the minimax algorithm to search good moves.
- Automatic Drop: Just sit back and watch the computer make completely random moves for both players - trust me, it's kind of satisfying to watch.

## Other features
- Physics-like animations make the game feel surprisingly natural.
- Adjust the size of the board and the number in a row needed to win.
